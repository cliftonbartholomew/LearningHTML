      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
          only the essential facts of life, and see if I could learn what it had
          to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
          I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I
          wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted
          to live deep and suck all the marrow out of life, to live so sturdily
          and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a
          broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce
          it to its lowest terms."
        </p>
